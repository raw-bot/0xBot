## Iteration 1 - Architecture & Design Patterns Analysis

### What Was Implemented
- Complete architectural analysis of 0xBot codebase
- Documented 12 key design patterns (blocks, services, DI, middleware, ORM, etc.)
- Analyzed overall project structure (backend: 77 Python files, frontend: 24 TS files)
- Created architectural diagrams and data flow documentation
- Identified strengths (modularity, async, type-safe) and weaknesses (no distributed scaling, single process)
- Documented 10 notable architectural decisions with rationale

### Files Changed
- No code files modified (analysis only)
- Output: Created comprehensive architecture analysis document

### Learnings for Future Iterations

#### Patterns Discovered
- **Block Orchestration:** Trading logic divided into composable blocks (MarketData → Portfolio → Decision → Risk → Execution)
- **Pluggable Decision Modes:** Multiple strategies can be selected per bot (indicator, trinity confluence, LLM-based)
- **Service Layer:** 23+ service classes provide business logic separation from routes
- **Async Throughout:** FastAPI + asyncio + async SQLAlchemy for concurrent operation
- **Memory Integration:** Optional DeepMem provider for bots to learn from profitable setups

#### Gotchas to Avoid
- **Single Process Constraint:** All bots run in one scheduler instance - cannot scale to multiple servers without refactoring
- **API-First Design:** REST endpoints (no GraphQL), simple CRUD operations
- **Paper Trading Default:** Trades are simulated in memory, switching to live requires OKX API keys
- **No Distributed Caching:** Redis only used for pub/sub, not for state caching
- **Frontend/Backend Coupling:** Frontend depends on specific REST API contract

#### Useful Context for Future Iterations
- Main orchestration: `backend/src/blocks/orchestrator.py` (300+ lines)
- Core infrastructure: `backend/src/core/` (config, database, Redis, exchange client, LLM client)
- Decision block selection: Configurable per bot via `bot.model_name` field
- Frontend data flow: Components use `useDashboard` hook which polls `/api/dashboard` every 5s
- Database models: 8 core entities (User, Bot, Position, Trade, EquitySnapshot, Signal, Alert, LLMDecision)

## Learnings & Patterns (Updated Per Iteration)

### Architecture Patterns to Preserve
1. **Block Orchestration Pattern:** Maintain separation of trading concerns (MarketData, Portfolio, Decision, Risk, Execution)
2. **Service Layer Abstraction:** Keep business logic in services, not routes
3. **Async-First:** All I/O operations should use async/await
4. **Type Safety:** Maintain type hints in Python, TypeScript on frontend
5. **Pluggable Decision Modes:** Allow strategy selection without code changes

### Common Gotchas to Avoid
1. **Distributed Scaling:** Any changes assuming single process only
2. **Synchronous Operations:** Blocking I/O in async context
3. **Tight Coupling:** Services should be injectable, not hard-coded imports
4. **Paper Trading Assumption:** Always document when code assumes simulated trades
5. **Frontend Polling:** Real-time updates only via polling (5s interval), no WebSocket implementation

### Useful Context for Future Iterations
- Scheduler runs every ~300s per bot cycle
- Decision blocks must return decisions in standard format: {symbol, side, size_pct, entry_price, stop_loss, take_profit}
- Memory system is optional (DeepMem provider if available, else DummyMemoryProvider)
- Database uses TimescaleDB for time-series optimization
- CORS is permissive (allows all origins) due to local development setup
