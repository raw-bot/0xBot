# AI Trading Agent - Product Specification

## Document Purpose
This specification defines WHAT the AI Trading Agent must do and WHY, 
without prescribing HOW to implement it. Implementation details are in plan.md.

---

## 1. Product Vision

### 1.1 Core Value Proposition
Deploy frontier LLMs (Claude, GPT, DeepSeek, Gemini) as autonomous crypto 
traders managing real capital 24/7 with complete transparency.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
- Manual crypto trading requires 24/7 attention (markets never close)
- Emotional decisions lead to poor trade execution (fear, greed, FOMO)
- Traders miss opportunities during sleep/work hours
- No easy way to test if AI can generate trading alpha

### 1.3 Target Users
- **Primary**: Intermediate/advanced crypto traders wanting AI automation
- **Secondary**: Researchers testing LLM financial capabilities  
- **Tertiary**: Tech-savvy investors seeking passive exposure

---

## 2. User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### ðŸŽ¯ User Story 1: Deploy AI Trader (Priority: P1 - MVP)

**As a** crypto trader  
**I want to** deploy an AI agent with my capital  
**So that** it trades autonomously while I sleep/work

**Why P1**: Core value prop - without this, there's no product.

**Independent Test**: User selects Claude, allocates $1000, starts agent, 
sees â‰¥1 trade within 24h with AI reasoning visible.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I'm authenticated on platform  
   **When** I select "Claude 4.5 Sonnet" and allocate $1000  
   **Then** agent activates and begins market analysis within 3 minutes

2. **Given** my agent is analyzing markets  
   **When** it identifies a high-confidence opportunity  
   **Then** it executes trade and I see position in dashboard with full reasoning

3. **Given** my agent has 3 open positions  
   **When** market conditions change (e.g., BTC drops 5%)  
   **Then** agent manages exits autonomously and updates PnL real-time

4. **Given** I want to stop trading  
   **When** I click "Deactivate Agent"  
   **Then** it closes all positions within 60 seconds and returns to cash

---

### ðŸŽ¯ User Story 2: Monitor Activity in Real-Time (Priority: P1 - MVP)

**As a** trader with active AI agent  
**I want to** see what my AI is doing and why, in real-time  
**So that** I can trust it with my capital

**Why P1**: Trust = capital allocation. Without transparency, users won't fund.

**Independent Test**: With active agent, dashboard shows: current positions, 
real-time PnL, recent AI analysis, trade history. Updates <5s after any action.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** my agent analyzed markets 30 seconds ago  
   **When** I open dashboard  
   **Then** I see latest analysis timestamp, key insights, confidence levels

2. **Given** my agent executes a $500 BTC long  
   **When** trade completes  
   **Then** I receive notification within 5 seconds with: asset, direction, 
          size, entry price, reasoning, stop-loss, take-profit

3. **Given** I want to understand a past decision  
   **When** I click on any trade in history  
   **Then** I see complete reasoning, market context at time, outcome

4. **Given** I have 5 open positions  
   **When** I view portfolio  
   **Then** I see real-time: position size, entry price, current price, 
          unrealized PnL, stop-loss, take-profit

---

### ðŸŽ¯ User Story 3: Customize Risk Parameters (Priority: P2)

**As a** trader with risk preferences  
**I want to** control how aggressively my AI trades  
**So that** it matches my risk tolerance

**Why P2**: Enables both conservative and aggressive traders to use platform.

**Independent Test**: User sets max position size (10%), max drawdown (20%), 
max trades/day (5). Agent respects all constraints in all decisions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I set max position size to 10% of capital  
   **When** agent identifies opportunity  
   **Then** it never allocates >10% to single position

2. **Given** my portfolio is down 15% and max drawdown is 20%  
   **When** agent evaluates new trades  
   **Then** it reduces position sizes and trades more conservatively

3. **Given** I set max 5 trades/day and agent made 5 trades  
   **When** new opportunity appears  
   **Then** agent skips it and waits until next day

4. **Given** I update risk parameters while agent is active  
   **When** changes are saved  
   **Then** they apply immediately to future trades without closing existing

---

### ðŸŽ¯ User Story 4: Compare AI Models (Priority: P3)

**As a** data-driven trader  
**I want to** run multiple AI models simultaneously  
**So that** I can discover which generates best alpha

**Why P3**: Power user feature that creates stickiness and differentiation.

**Independent Test**: User deploys Claude, GPT-4, DeepSeek, Gemini with $1000 
each. Dashboard shows comparative metrics: win rate, Sharpe, drawdown, PnL.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I want to compare models  
   **When** I create 4 agents with $1000 each  
   **Then** all agents operate independently without interference

2. **Given** 4 agents are trading for 7 days  
   **When** I view comparison dashboard  
   **Then** I see side-by-side: total trades, win rate, avg duration, PnL, Sharpe

3. **Given** Claude outperforms others by 15%  
   **When** I increase its capital to $5000  
   **Then** capital updates without stopping other agents

4. **Given** same market drop affects all agents  
   **When** I review model-specific audit trails  
   **Then** I see how different AIs approached same conditions differently

---

### ðŸŽ¯ User Story 5: Receive Smart Alerts (Priority: P3)

**As a** trader who can't watch 24/7  
**I want to** be notified of significant events only  
**So that** I stay aware without alert fatigue

**Why P3**: Enables awareness without constant monitoring.

**Independent Test**: User receives alerts for: trades >5% capital, PnL changes 
>10% daily, approaching risk limits. No alerts for routine analysis.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** agent executes trade >5% of capital  
   **When** trade completes  
   **Then** I receive push notification with details

2. **Given** portfolio drops 10% in one day  
   **When** threshold crossed  
   **Then** I'm alerted with drawdown details and agent's plan

3. **Given** my 20% max drawdown limit and portfolio at 18%  
   **When** agent calculates risk  
   **Then** I receive warning before limit hit

4. **Given** I configure custom alert preferences  
   **When** I set thresholds for PnL, position size, volatility  
   **Then** alerts respect my preferences

---

### ðŸš¨ Edge Cases (Critical for Robustness)

1. **Exchange API Down**  
   - Agent must pause trading immediately
   - Log issue with timestamp
   - Alert user via all channels (email, push)
   - Resume automatically when connection restored
   - Never execute trades without confirmation

2. **AI Produces Invalid Trade**  
   - System validates: asset exists, size >minimum, price reasonable
   - Reject invalid trades immediately
   - Alert user with details
   - Log for debugging/model improvement
   - Continue operation normally

3. **Rapid Market Crash** (e.g., -20% in 10 minutes)  
   - Emergency stop-loss overrides AI decisions
   - Close all positions if drawdown velocity >threshold
   - Alert user immediately
   - Require manual re-activation
   - Preserve capital above all

4. **Insufficient Capital**  
   - Agent detects capital below minimum trade size
   - Pause trading automatically
   - Alert user: "Need minimum $X to continue"
   - Resume when capital added

5. **Conflicting AI Signals**  
   - System prioritizes: exit > entry, stop-loss > take-profit
   - Risk management always overrides opportunity
   - Log conflicts for analysis
   - Execute highest-priority action only

6. **Asset Delisting**  
   - Agent auto-liquidates position before delisting
   - Alert user immediately
   - Blacklist asset from future trading
   - Log event with reasoning

7. **Model Version Update**  
   - Track which model version made which trades
   - Notify user of available updates
   - Allow opt-in to new versions (no auto-update)
   - Maintain audit trail across versions
